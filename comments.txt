I spend about 4-5 hours trying to get the MongoDB working, I don't know what the things in docker-compose.yml all do,
I spend too long on it to understand it. The MongoDB seeding is from:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31210973/how-do-i-seed-a-mongo-database-using-docker-compose
With some inspriration and testing from:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45935912/seed-mongodb-inside-a-docker-container

Basic documentation in the code due to limited time.

connector.py, in /Connector/, connects to the API and parses through a .json file and retrieves all the items in that file.
It stores them in another file with a similar name. 'json_format.txt' shows the format the .json file needs to be,
aswell as a basic example. The example doesn't return anything useful though.

Scripts used to create the .json for the MongoDB are found in /VCF_Scripts/.

To build the containers, use docker-compose up --build in this folder.
I know I spelt BioProdict as Biopredict, but I'm working on an external linux desktop connected with ssh. FileZilla broke for me
for some reason and I can't be asked to change the folder name with linux commands. Most of the editing of scripts and debugging 
was done with nano because of that aswell.
